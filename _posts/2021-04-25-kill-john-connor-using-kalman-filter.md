*On the cover: T-X Terminator from Terminator3: Rise of the Machines (2003)*

Let's say you are the super hot T-X Terminator sent from the future by Skynet. Your mission is to destroy a young John Connor who later on becomes the leader of the Resistance (booooo). You started your mission, took some damage, but fought off a relentless and annoying T-850 (Arnold Schwaznegger) and disabled it. However you see John Connor and his girlfriend Katherine trying to escape in a motorcycle. You are at the top of a bridge and see them getting away from you. Your long range weapons are damaged, hence you grab a shoulder-fired missile from the scene that has one missile left. You are now weapons hot and ready to engage but only with one shot. Ready to make it count? Let's do it!

The problem here is to track the motorcycle. Once tracked, it is fairly easy for you to aim and shoot. For tracking, let's say that you have to estimate the motorcycle's position $p_t$ and velocity $v_t$ at a given point of time $t$. You can also estimate other variables like acceleration of the motorcycle but let's keep it simple. Let's call this the **state** $\mathbf{x}_t$ of the system. You also need to track the **uncertainity** of your state $\mathbf{P}_t$ which is nothing but the covariance matrix.

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
\mathbf{x}_t &= \begin{bmatrix} 
p_t\\ 
v_t
\end{bmatrix}
\\
\mathbf{P}_t &= \begin{bmatrix} 
\Sigma_{pp} & \Sigma_{pv} \\ 
\Sigma_{vp} & \Sigma_{vv}
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}
$$

Since $p_t$ and $v_t$ are uncorrelated at a time step $t$, the non-diagonal terms in the covaraince matrix are zero. 

You have at your disposal:
1. An inbuilt **physics-kinematics model** that predicts the current state of the target based on it's previous state
2. A **vision sensor** that measures the current state of the motorcycle, but gives noisy readings due to damage during the fight with T-850
3. A **GPS tracker** that tracks Katherine's cellphone and also measures the current state of the target (stupid humans)


The prediction from the physics model may not be accurate because the bike can encounter unforseen obstacles that might decrease it's speed or slip on the road. The vision sensor estimates are only accurate to a certain extent since it is faulty from the fight. And the GPS is not that accuracte since you're forced to use 20th century technology at this time. However you do know the uncertainity of these estimates in terms of their covariances. 

So how do you determine the state of the target before taking your final shot? You could just choose one or take an average of the estimates. But this will not yield the best estimate and you could miss your shot. Fortunately Skynet has equiped you with Kalman filters :D Now we gonna get that kill oooo yeh. Kalman filter is a state estimation technique that lets you combine multiple uncertain measurements. It essentially has two steps:

1. Predict: Estimate the current state from previous state according to the kinematics model
2. Update: Combine sensor measurements recursively to the prediction above

**NOTE:**
The following equations with their color schemes are adopted from this very nice explanation [here](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/). Also for a slightly non-flattering explanation refer [this document](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rmf25/papers/Understanding%20the%20Basis%20of%20the%20Kalman%20Filter.pdf).

## Predict:

In this step the physics-kinematics model of the system is used to predict the current state based on the previous state. There's a Markovian assumption here (the current state only depends on the previous state) that saves a lot of storage resources for Kalman filters. You have to write the transition equations for both the state and it's uncertainity. Simple kinematics tells us the following:

$$
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split} 
\color{deeppink}{p_t} &= \color{royalblue}{p_{t-1}} + {\Delta t} &\color{royalblue}{v_{t-1}} \\ 
\color{deeppink}{v_t} &= &\color{royalblue}{v_{t-1}} 
\end{split} \\

\begin{split} 
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} &= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & \Delta t \\ 
0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
\color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{t-1}} \\

\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} &= \mathbf{F}_t \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{t-1}}
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mathbf{F}_t$ is the state transition matrix. Notice that the state transition equation is time independent ($\Delta t$ is just the pre-defined incremental) and linear. Kalman filter assumes that the system is linear and the variables and noises are Gaussian. If the equations are non-linear and time dependent then we can use an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) that makes Taylor-series approximations to obtain locally linear values. There are other variants of Kalman filter such as Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) that deal with highly non-linear systems and Discriminative Kalman filter (DKF) that deal with non-Gaussian variables.

If there are **known** forces that are external influences, one can also add this into the equation: 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} &= \mathbf{F}_t \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{t-1}} + \mathbf{B}_t \color{darkorange}{\mathbf{u}_t}
\end{aligned} 
$$ 
where $\mathbf{B}_t$ is called the control matrix and $\color{darkorange}{\mathbf{u}_t}$ the control vector. This comes in handy when the system is in your control, say you're estimating the state of your robot that you're controlling through motors. In this case you can add force/torque/acceleration as the control vector.This is not the case here, as John Connor is the one driving the motorcycle (system).

Also most times, unknown forces (such as road slip and obstacles in this case) are always involved. Let's assume a Gaussian noise vector $\color{tan}{\mathbf{w_t}}$. The true state then becomes (notice the absence of hat):
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{x}_t} &= \mathbf{F}_t \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{x}_{t-1}} + \mathbf{B}_t \color{darkorange}{\mathbf{u}_t} + \color{tan}{\mathbf{w_t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now the prediction equation for the uncertainity is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{P}_t} &= \mathbf{F_t} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_{t-1}} \mathbf{F}_t^T + \color{tan}{\mathbf{Q}_t} 
\end{aligned}
$$

Here the $\color{tan}{\mathbf{Q}_t}$ is nothing but the variance of the Gaussian noise $\color{tan}{\mathbf{w_t}}$. The first term can be derived according to the following rule of covariance:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
Cov(x) &= \Sigma\\ 
Cov(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}x) &= \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}} \Sigma \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}^T 
\end{aligned}
$$

## Update:
In this step, the measurements of the sensors are combined with the predictions of the kinematics model. Skynet has equiped you an advanced tracking algorithm (say DeepSort) that tells you both the position and velocity of a target in the video feed. Let's say the vision sensor's **observed measurement and uncertainity** is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\color{mediumaquamarine}{\mu_1}, \color{mediumaquamarine}{\Sigma_1}) = (\color{mediumaquamarine}{\mathbf{z}_t}, \color{mediumaquamarine}{\mathbf{R}_t})
\end{aligned}
$$

From the prediction step of Kalman filter, you have a predicted state estimate and it's uncertainity. Let's convert that into sensor readings using an observation matrix $\mathbf{H_t}$. The observation matrix essentially relates the units of sensor measurement to that of the state vector. For example the observation matrix stores conversions between your GPS readings in latitudes & longitudes and meters in the state vector. The **predicted measurement and uncertainity** is then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\color{deeppink}{\mu_0}, \color{deeppink}{\Sigma_0}) = (\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{\hat{x}}_t}, \ \  \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T})
\end{aligned}
$$

The predicted uncertainity follows from the covariance rule just like before. Now you have two Gaussian probability densities in your hand and you can combine them. For a multivariate Gaussian, the probability density is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}, \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{2 \pi^{k/2} \ \|\Sigma\|^{-1/2}} \exp\Big[-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\mu) \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\mu)^T \Big]
\end{equation}
$$

A nice property of Gaussians is that the combination (product of their pdfs) of Gaussians yield a (scaled) Gaussain as well. A tutorial with derivation is provided [here](http://www.lucamartino.altervista.org/2003-003.pdf) for the univariate case. Without getting too mathy, combining two multivariate Gaussians after normalization yields another Gaussian with mean $ \color{mediumblue}{\mu’}$ and covariance $\color{mediumblue}{\Sigma’}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}, \color{deeppink}{\mu_0}, \color{deeppink}{\Sigma_0}) \cdot \mathcal{N}(x, \color{mediumaquamarine}{\mu_1}, \color{mediumaquamarine}{\Sigma_1}) \stackrel{?}{=} \mathcal{N}(x, \color{mediumblue}{\mu’}, \color{mediumblue}{\Sigma’})
\end{aligned}
$$

Defining Kalman Gain as $\color{green}{\mathbf{K}}$,

$$
\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned} 
\color{green}{\mathbf{K}} &= \Sigma_0 (\Sigma_0 + \Sigma_1)^{-1} \\
\color{mediumblue}{\mu’} &= \color{deeppink}{\mu_0} + \color{green}{\mathbf{K}} (\color{mediumaquamarine}{\mu_1} – \color{deeppink}{\mu_0})\\ 
\color{mediumblue}{\Sigma’} &= \color{deeppink}{\Sigma_0} – \color{green}{\mathbf{K}} \color{deeppink}{\Sigma_0} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

Here we can observe that Kalman gain defines the importance of sensor measurements against the kinematic predictions. If the $\color{green}{\mathbf{K}} \rightarrow 0$ then the sensor measurements are highly unreliable. If $\color{green}{\mathbf{K}} \rightarrow 1$ then the sensor measurements are quite reliable and can be solely used for state estimate. Now, substituiting the means and covariances from kinematic estimate and sensor estimate into the above combined mean and covariance equations gives us:

$$
\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned} 
\mathbf{H}_t \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t’} &= \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} & + & \color{green}{\mathbf{K}} ( \color{mediumaquamarine}{\mathbf{z}_t} – \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} ) \\ 
\mathbf{H}_t \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_t’} \mathbf{H}_t^T &= \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T} & – & \color{green}{\mathbf{K}} \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

And the Kalman gain,

$$
\begin{equation}
\color{green}{\mathbf{K}} = \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T} ( \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T} + \color{mediumaquamarine}{\mathbf{R}_t})^{-1} 
\end{equation}
$$

We can remove $\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t}$ from front of these equations (there's a $\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t}$ inside $\color{green}{\mathbf{K}}$) and a $\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t^T}$ in rear of the covariance equation and simplify. We get,

$$
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split} 
\color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t’} &= \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} & + & \color{green}{\mathbf{K}’} ( \color{mediumaquamarine}{\mathbf{z}_t} – \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{\hat{x}}_t} ) \\ 
\color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_t’} &= \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{P}_t} & – & \color{green}{\mathbf{K}’} \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t} 
\end{split} \\

\color{green}{\mathbf{K}’} = \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T} ( \color{deeppink}{\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t \mathbf{H}_t^T} + \color{mediumaquamarine}{\mathbf{R}_t})^{-1} 
\label{kalgainfull} 
\end{equation}
$$

Now you have combined the information from kinematics model and the vision sensor. Wait, what about the GPS sensor? Well, you just use a subsequent update step just like above to combine the information from GPS sensor as well. It doesn't matter in what order you update these measurements. Viola! You got what you wanted. A combined state estimate from Kalman filter. These values $\color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_t’}$ and $\color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_t’}$ can be subsequently plugged in and used to predict the next state using kinematics and update using sensor measurements in a loop. 

A few seconds of tracking using Kalman filter and you got yourself a target lock. Now fire that missile at John Connor. Boo-yeah! Skynet now has a resistance free future! Mission accomplished. Hasta la what? Yeah, that's right.
