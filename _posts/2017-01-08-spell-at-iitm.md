Disclaimer: This is not another clich√©d "I'm graduated; insti1 is so awesome" post. Apologies in advance if I'm being a little pessimistic. This is a small account of my spell in Insti[^1].

I'm a frustrated mechanical engineer by choice. Why you ask? "IITM is best known for Mechanical no?" "Mechanical na gethu da!" kind of deluded talks fell into my parents' ears. Yep, it was totally my fault to be undecided after JEE. And I'm not entirely blaming the department for which IITM is so renown for. Worth mentioning that mech was the bomb, but that was in the past. Mech was the CS four decades back. No, we aren't outdated; it's just that we are up to date with the 20th century. I feel the syllabus was never revamped after that. Now who's to blame for all the less than 10% core-placements? I was totally convinced that I had no choice except to suck up and go for finance or analytics. Is it a coincidence that everyone knows Andrew Ng? Well at least one good thing happened. I surmised that ML is the thing I'm gonna go for because it is exciting.

By the way, is it just me or does anyone else feel that sometimes with all the research work and the conceptual study, the entire curriculum at IIT and the further education's end result is just aimed towards churning out the best academicians in the world? Think about it.. What's the best thing you could become if you just "studied well" all along your life like your parents advised you? You'd end up being a lecturer. So is that what every parent wants at the end of the day? Just some thought to ponder upon.

Insti has always offered me something new to learn but in the agonizing ways possible. I think the sole purpose of insti is not to finish assignments on time or to get accustomed to the 8AM waking up schedule or getting that damn S grade which is considered esteemed. I still remember my MA101[^2] 1st Quiz score. It was 9/20. I had skipped those classes in which answer scripts were distributed. I had to go and collect it directly from the prof. When I went to him, he asked me why I flunked the class. I said it was difficult for me to understand the math and that I needed time. He replied, "Well, why do you even join the insti wasting your parents' money?". That was a serious blow to my self esteem. All my life I have been a first ranker in my class and now I'm a disgrace to my parents? I ought to be missing something. I hit me later on that every single one of us has been sucked into this virtual rat race vortex at insti.

Okay, I gotta survive this race now. What am I gonna do? Find a companion to share my grief and joy? You know, emotional well being? Ehh.. You're wrong. The gender ratio is so skewed here that it makes you think that girls are an endangered species. It is more likely for a girl to scoot away from you than does a black buck. Also with most of the HS girls under the impression that the engineering guys reek of desperation (which is kinda true to be honest), finding a girlfriend is no ordinary task. You either have to be a sad guitarist or an enthusiastic photographer. No hard promises though.

Insti made me realize that I'm no special. I'm just another speck among this insane amount of immensely talented people. Anybody who's not a special snowflake or isn't famous nor holding a core PoR[^3]  (which is overrated btw) has gone through the depression cycle here. How many binge watched 'Friends' or 'The Big Bang Theory' or 'How I Met Your Mother' just as an escapade here? If you haven't figured out life, don't worry, it's very much possible that you'll get used to it. That's just to say that you don't have to be sorted. Insti will sort you out.

Insti has offered so many ups and downs. From the lowest being doubting my own self-worth (more like contemplating my existence) to patting myself on the back. I even have theories supporting my cause of ending it all because I thought I was worthless. Why? Coz we are all just an organic heap; singing and dancing crap of the world -*Fight Club*. But then again it gives me this strange strength to pick myself up again and work for the things I love.

Strangely insti is compassionate but in a cruel way though. It teaches you the really important life lessons. One such lesson that I constantly remind myself is to give no f**ks. The lesser f**ks you give, more the happy you are. Be responsible but give less f**ks. Being nice is one thing but sometimes you gotta be a narcissistic a**hole.

Insti is very contrastive in nature. From being surrounded by crazy friends one day to loneliest of nights in the next; from the cherished cfi night-outs to the mandatory night-outs before end sems; from the favourite exquisite chai at Ramu to unpalatable gulpworthy tea in mess; from the must-attend EMLs[^4] to the trifling class lectures; from fmovies to iitmcivil site; from the DC++[^5] to the Ansys Fluent; from the chilly night smoke up sessions to the sweltering first year workshops; from the late night walks after a night show in Luke's to the long walk to class after we missed the 7:50 AM bus; from the expensive treats in ABS to the 20 rupees ice cream treats in guru; from Game of Thrones to NPTEL[^6] lectures. I could go on, but you get the gist eh?..

Well, it all went by in a flash. It's feels like I was just sitting down for a movie and the next thing you know they are playing the end credits. It's that crazy. It's all in a haze. Insti never ceases to amaze me. I still try to make sense of this resplendent chaos; I probably will never understand.. I don't mind it though, because the simplest of pleasures are the intense ones.

I'm grateful to my loving parents who understood me for who I am. I doubt I would have made it through even half of it, if not for them.

PS: I got a Tinder date within two days of graduation. Probably because I was just out of this curse called Mechanical Engineering.

PPS: Thanks for reading with patience. Peace out - CG.
