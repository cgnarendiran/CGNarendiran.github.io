Hi, my name is Naren. People call me CG (hence the logo). I'm a second year masters student from University of Amsterdam ([UvA](https://www.uva.nl)) majoring in Artificial Intellegence. My academic and research interests lie in Transfer Learning, Generative Modeling and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I'm currently finishing up my thesis on "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for entity recognition". 

My technical skills include Python, C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Apache Spark, Pandas, SQL, Git, ROS
