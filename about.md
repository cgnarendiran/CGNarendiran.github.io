Hi, my name is Naren. People call me CG (hence the logo). I'm a second year masters student from University of Amsterdam ([UvA](https://www.uva.nl)) majoring in Artificial Intellegence. My academic and research interests lie in Transfer Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I'm currently finishing up my thesis on "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for entity recognition". 

I'm actively seeking jobs in the fields of Data Science, Data Analytics and Machine Learning from September 2020.
