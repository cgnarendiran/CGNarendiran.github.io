Hi, my name is Naren. People call me CG (hence the logo). Masters in AI from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.uva.nl">UvA</a>. 
Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IITM</a>. My masters thesis was on "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for entity recognition in text".
I like geeking out on recent advancements in AI and playing ukulele & chess in my free time. 

I work at <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.minds.ai/">minds.ai</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer. My focus here includes building, testing and gathering insights on RL models that address the WIP flow bottlenecks in semiconductor manufacturing process. As a part-time job, I'm also building an ML based clinical decision support system that includes drug efficacy, patient clustering and risk profiling at <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.diabwellness.ai/">diabwellness.ai</a>.
