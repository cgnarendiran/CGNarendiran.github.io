Hi, my name is Naren. People call me CG (hence the logo). Masters in AI from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.uva.nl">UvA</a>. 
Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IITM</a>. 
I like geeking out on recent advancements in AI and playing ukulele & chess in my free time. 

I recently graduated from University of Amsterdam (UvA) majoring in Artificial Intellegence. My thesis was on "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for entity recognition in text". My interests these days lie in how one can combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and segementation models (like Mask RCNN) to construct related explainable features which can be used in the downstream tasks.
