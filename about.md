Hi, my name is Naren. People call me CG (hence the logo). Masters in AI from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.uva.nl">UvA</a>. 
Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IITM</a>. 
I like geeking out on recent advancements in AI and playing ukulele & chess in my free time. 

I recently graduated from University of Amsterdam (UvA) majoring in Artificial Intellegence. My thesis was on "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for entity recognition in text". My technical skills include Python, C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, Git, ROS, SQL, Docker.
