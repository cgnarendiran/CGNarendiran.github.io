Hi, my name is Naren. People call me CG (hence the logo). Masters in AI from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a>. Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a>. My masters thesis was on "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for entity recognition in text". I like geeking out on recent advancements in AI and playing ukulele & chess in my free time.

I currently work at <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.minds.ai/">minds.ai</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer. My focus here includes building and testing RL models and gathering insights that address the WIP flow bottlenecks in semiconductor manufacturing process. I'm also building an AI based clinical decision support system with value adds such as drug effectiveness and complication risk profiling at <a style="color:teal" href="https://www.diabwellness.ai/">diabwellness.ai</a>.
